# User Quick Start & Practice Guide

This guide is for learners who want immediate, confidence-building wins. Every section is self-contained—if you can copy commands, you can finish these exercises.

## 1. Quick Start (15 minutes)

1. **Get the files**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book-dev.git
   cd cs249r_book-dev
   ```
2. **Install the one tool you really need**: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started) (handles the book, kits, and labs).
3. **Install Python 3.10+** (if you do not already have it).
4. **Create and activate the project environment**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Build your first chapter**
   ```powershell
   cd book
   ./binder build intro
   ```
   The helper script lives in `book/cli/main.py:39-205`; it prints each step so you can follow along.
6. **Open the generated page**: double-click `book/quarto/_build/html/intro/index.html`.

You now have a local copy of the textbook. Continue with the use cases below to explore hands-on labs and TinyTorch modules.

## 2. Ten Confidence-Building Use Cases

Each use case is intentionally short and references the exact command path so you can connect the action to the source files.

| # | Goal | Steps | Why it’s valuable |
|---|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Read a chapter offline** | `cd book && ./binder build intro` → open `_build/html/intro/index.html` | Shows how the Quarto pipeline converts `book/quarto/contents/*` into a static site using the CLI dispatcher in `book/cli/main.py:39-205`. |
| 2 | **Live-edit a chapter** | `./binder preview benchmarking` → edit `book/quarto/contents/core/benchmarking.qmd` | Hot reload lets you see changes immediately; reinforces the config system handled by `ConfigManager` (`book/cli/core/config.py:15-108`). |
| 3 | **Export a PDF** | `./binder pdf --all` | Produces `_build/pdf/Machine-Learning-Systems.pdf` so you can study offline; runs the same build that powers https://mlsysbook.ai. |
| 4 | **Build your first tensor** | `cd tinytorch && ./bin/tito module start 01` → run the notebook in `tinytorch/src/01_tensor/01_tensor.py:258-520` | Shows how the TinyTorch CLI (see `tinytorch/bin/tito:1-34`) launches curriculum modules without installing PyTorch. |
| 5 | **Trace gradients** | `./bin/tito module start 06` → inspect `Function` classes in `tinytorch/src/06_autograd/06_autograd.py:233-410` | Understanding autograd demystifies how training updates weights. |
| 6 | **Train a mini-CNN** | `./bin/tito module start 09` followed by `module test 09` | Reuses the shared `DataLoader` (`tinytorch/src/05_dataloader/05_dataloader.py:575-890`) and the `Trainer` (`tinytorch/src/08_training/08_training.py:502-780`) so you see a full loop. |
| 7 | **Experiment with attention** | `./bin/tito module start 12` → tweak head counts inside `tinytorch/src/12_attention/12_attention.py:691-884` | Lets you connect theory to implementation by editing a dozen lines. |
| 8 | **Quantize a model** | `./bin/tito module start 15` → run the quantization unit tests around `tinytorch/src/15_quantization/15_quantization.py:372-1380` | Shrinks models by 4× and prepares you for hardware deployment. |
| 9 | **Benchmark progress** | `./bin/tito benchmark run mnist` followed by `./bin/tito milestone status` | Teaches you how the CLI aggregates checkpoints stored in `.tinytorch/`. |
|10 | **Run a hardware lab** | `cd kits && quarto preview` → follow the “Image Classification” lab in `kits/README.md:20-70` on your board of choice | Demonstrates how documentation, firmware flashing, and datasets fit together before you attempt more advanced deployments. |

Do these in any order. Each one ends with a tangible outcome (rendered page, trained model, or flashed device) so you stay motivated.

## 3. Staying Motivated

* **Track wins visually**: open `_build/html/index.html` after every book edit or lab run—you will literally watch the site grow.
* **Record module progress**: `./bin/tito module status` displays a color-coded table generated by `TinyTorchCLI` (`tinytorch/tito/main.py:76-220`).
* **Share screenshots**: drop renders or terminal captures into your study group or GitHub Discussion threads to celebrate milestones.

## 4. When You’re Ready for More

1. Explore the detailed architecture diagrams in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Read `docs/DEVELOPERS.md` if you want to contribute code or documentation.
3. Join the community discussions listed near the top of `README.md` for real-time support.

No matter what you do next, you already have ten concrete successes behind you—keep building!
